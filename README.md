<h1>Infinite Runner Base Game</h1>

<h3>Update</h3>
<h4>This repo was created with Unity 4 and uses that version of unfity to create the infinite runner game. An updated version of this game using Unity 5.2 can be found here - https://github.com/KatVHarris/GravityInfiniteRunner-Unity5-Base

I've updated parts of the modules and add new entries for people using Unity5.2 and higher.

<h3>Hey Everyone!</h3>
So this project is the base game for building out kinect and oculus controls!
All the instructions are at the Instructables site: http://www.instructables.com/id/Virtual-Reality-Games-and-Making-Your-Body-a-Contr/

The pieces are also on my blog, as well as some insights into Unity development in general. I will also have the tutorials for how to create all the modules for the gravity infinite runner game there: http://kaharri.com or http://blogs.msdn.com/katherineharris

Happy Coding!
