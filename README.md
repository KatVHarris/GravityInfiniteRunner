<h1>Infinite Runner Base Game</h1>
Hey Everyone!
So this project is the base game for building out kinect and oculus controls!
All the instructions are at the Instructables site: http://www.instructables.com/id/Virtual-Reality-Games-and-Making-Your-Body-a-Contr/

The pieces are also on my blog, as well as some insights into Unity development in general. I will also have the tutorials for how to create all the modules for the gravity infinite runner game there: http://kaharri.com or http://blogs.msdn.com/katherineharris

Happy Coding!
